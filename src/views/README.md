# Pygame Views (Deprecated)

This directory contains the legacy code for the Phase 3/4 Terminal/Pygame client interface.

These Python-based UI elements (such as `dashboard_view.py`) were used to originally test the data models and simulation engine. They have been officially deprecated and superseded by the React components in the `frontend/` directory, but are retained here for architectural reference of the old UI State Manager.
