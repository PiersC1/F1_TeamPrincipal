# Backend Python Engine

This folder contains the entire mathematical simulation logic, saving/loading state, and data modeling for the game. 

It is completely decoupled from the UI, meaning it can be run "headless" via the FastAPI server in `api/` or driven by the older `Pygame` terminal window tests.
