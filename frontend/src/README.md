# Frontend Source

Contains the core routing and styling files for the React application.

*   `App.jsx`: The main entry point that fetches the `GameState` from the FastAPI backend and handles "routing" to the different views (Dashboard, R&D, Race Weekend).
*   `main.jsx`: Bootstraps the React DOM.
*   `index.css`: Houses Tailwind directives and custom scrollbar overrides.
